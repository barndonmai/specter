# web-fallback

Specter's last line of defense before fabrication.

The Harvester is the source of truth. When it misses, we don't guess — we go to the authoritative legislature website, fetch the page, **anchor-check** that the cited section actually appears on it, and only then cite it.

## When to use this skill

- `harvester-query.lookup_citation()` returned `None` for a specific citation.
- User asks for a state we haven't ingested yet.
- User asks for a citation in a state we *have* ingested but the specific section is missing (renumbered, new amendment, etc.).

## When NOT to use it

- Don't use it for general semantic search ("DUI laws everywhere"). That's the Harvester's job.
- Don't use it for case law (this skill is statute-only).
- Don't use it as a *first* resort. Always Harvester first.

## The hard rule

**No fabrication, ever.** Per hackathon ground rules, "records without a real source URL don't count."

This skill enforces that with five rules:

1. **URL is built deterministically from the citation** — never asked from a language model.
2. **The fetched page must actually contain the section number** before we cite it.
3. **The model only summarizes** the fetched text — never invents content.
4. **Failed fetches return a structured miss** — Specter says "no verified source" rather than guessing.
5. **Only `.gov` / official legislature domains** are in the URL builder map.

## How to call

```bash
cd ~/Specter && python3 -m openclaw.skills.web_fallback.verify "Cal. Veh. Code § 22350"
```

```python
from openclaw.skills.web_fallback.verify import verify
result = verify("Cal. Veh. Code § 22350")
# {
#   "verified": True,
#   "citation": "Cal. Veh. Code § 22350",
#   "section": "22350",
#   "url": "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22350.",
#   "text": "<actual fetched statute text>",
#   "fetched_at": "2026-05-09T15:34:12Z"
# }
```

On failure:
```python
# {
#   "verified": False,
#   "citation": "Cal. Veh. Code § 99999",
#   "reason": "section number 99999 not found on fetched page"
# }
```

### Optional: summarize the verified text

If `verify()` succeeds and you want a Specter-voiced one-liner instead of the raw statute text:

```python
from openclaw.skills.web_fallback.summarize import summarize_verified
short = summarize_verified(result)  # one constrained sentence, no fabrication
```

`summarize_verified` calls Claude with a tightly-scoped prompt that forbids new facts beyond the supplied text. If `result["verified"]` is False, it returns `None` — never invents.

## Supported jurisdictions

URL builders are deterministic per state. Currently:

| State | Code | Source |
|---|---|---|
| California | `Cal. Veh. Code` | leginfo.legislature.ca.gov |
| Texas | `Tex. Transp. Code` | statutes.capitol.texas.gov |
| New York | `N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law` | nysenate.gov |
| Florida | `Fla. Stat.` | leg.state.fl.us |
| Illinois | `625 ILCS` | ilga.gov |

For unsupported jurisdictions, `verify()` returns:
```json
{"verified": false, "reason": "no authoritative URL pattern for <code>"}
```

Specter should then say: *"No authoritative source on hand for {jurisdiction}. Worth ingesting."*

## Format for WhatsApp

If verified, Specter answers like this (per SOUL voice rules — short, cited, source URL flagged):

> Cal. Veh. Code § 22350. Basic speed law — drive no faster than reasonable for conditions.
> Pulled live from leginfo.legislature.ca.gov. Not in the Harvester yet — worth ingesting.

If not verified:

> No verified source for {citation}. I won't make one up.

That's the whole skill. Verify or refuse.
